    "summary" : "- 1 - \n\nMINUTES of the 2nd meeting of the ICH NGO Forum Steering Committee \n \nSkype meeting, 22 January 2020, 15–17 (Paris time) \n \nPresent: Jorge Gustavo Caicedo, Naila Ceribašić, Dong Hwan Choi, Butholezwe \nKgosi Nyathi, Kaloyan Nikolov, Meg Nömgård \n \nAbsent: Reme Sakr (excused because her class lasted longer than planned) \n \nGabriele Desiderio joined on agenda items 1-4.d. Information to all accredited NGOs on the ICH NGO Forum pre-14.COM and \n\n14.COM activities (summaries and reports of all sessions) \n4.d. Due to technical issues, and moving \nfrom Skype to Zoom and back to Skype, it started at 15:30. Naila Ceribašić will send them tomorrow to Gabriele \nDesiderio, who will publish them at the Forum’s website. Publication of the Newsletter  \nThe Committee discussed the number of Newsletters planned for 2020, the ways to \nincrease their visibility and their publication in both English and French. It was \ndecided to publish three Newsletters during the 2020 – first in early February, \nfocused on the Forum’s activities in Bogotá, second in June after the GA, and third \nin November before 15.COM. Naila Ceribašić will be in charge of preparing \nmaterial in English, Dong Hwan Choi for translations to French, Butholezwe \nKgosi Nyathi in collaboration with Gabriele Desiderio for their editing and layout \nfor the Newsletters, and Kaloyan Nikolov for photos. Related to agenda item 4.b., \nButholezwe Kgosi Nyathi will also work on increasing the visibility of Newsletter. Updating the structure and information available at ICH NGO Forum \n\nwebsite \nButholezwe Kgosi Nyathi and Kaloyan Nikolov will work on this matter in close \ncollaboration with Gabriele Desiderio. Until Friday, 24 January, all members of the Committee should send to Gabriele \ntheir photos and short biographies (up to 200 words) to be published on the \nForum’s website. Information to all accredited NGOs on the ICH NGO Forum pre-14.COM \n\nand 14.COM activities (summaries and reports of all sessions) \nNaila Ceribašić sent a letter to all chairs/moderators/facilitators of the sessions who \ndid not submit their reports already in Bogotá. Afterwards, all summaries and received reports will be \nincluded in the Newsletter, and send to all accredited NGOs together with the \ninformation concerning the adoption of the Bylaws and the Code of Conduct. New logo of the Forum \nIn order to include French version of the Forum’s name in its logo, the Committee \ncontacted Gabriele Desiderio, who created several options. One of them was \nselected by the Committee as the new official logo of the Forum, along with the \nother one that is only in English (and includes the text “Intangible Cultural \nHeritage and Civil Society”), which will be revised in due time to also include \nFrench. 5 of the adopted Bylaws, “any NGO accredited to the Convention \nshall be considered a member of the ICH NGO Forum after being informed in this \nregard, unless it declines membership in the ICH NGO Forum.” Therefore the \nCommittee has to inform all accredited NGOs about the adoption of these two \n\n\n\n \n\n - 3 - \n\nstatutory documents, including the information about their status of member \nNGOs. The Committee discussed whether a more formal endorsement and/or \nconsent to the Bylaws should be requested, whether it should be directed only to \nnewly-accredited or all accredited NGOs, as well as advantages and disadvantages \nof such a request. However, with further strengthening of the Forum, the Committee may \npropose to the General Assembly – perhaps already to the next GA to be held \nduring 15.COM – a revision of the art. The information on the adopted Bylaws and Code of conduct, including the \ninformation related to art. 5, will be send to all accredited NGOs in (early) \nFebruary, together with summaries and reports of all sessions held in Bogotá, and a \nrequest to update information relating to their activities which is available at the \nForum’s website. It relates to the organization of a symposium or a workshop to be held in \nMexico in collaboration with the Steering Committee, and/or a publication within \nthe #HeritageAlive series. Preparation of programme for 8.GA \nDue to a lack of time, this agenda item will be addressed at the next meeting. Preparation of programme for 15.COM \nDue to a lack of time, this agenda item will be addressed at the next meeting. Financial report \nIt has appeared that the financial document related to the operation of the \nCommittee’s account in France was, by mistake, not signed by all members of the \nCommittee. A new ICH NGO Forum account \nAs agreed upon in Bogotá, Kaloyan Nikolov examined the frame of operation of \nwallet companies (such as ravolut.com, vialet.eu, and others), which provide bank \naccounts in virtual space. Follow-up on each member responsibilities \nDue to a lack of time, this agenda item will be addressed at the next meeting. Jorge Gustavo Caicedo \nwill solve all possible technical difficulties in advance, so that meetings can start at \nexactly 3 p.m., Paris time. The next meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, 5 February, 15-17, Paris time. Minutes drafted by Naila Ceribašić on 23 January 2020; approved by the Steering \nCommittee on 5 February 2020, followed by their publication on the ICH NGO \nForum website; translation into French made by Dong Hwan Choi."
